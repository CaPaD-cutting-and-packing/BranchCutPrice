  BB Col Gen has taken >1e+06 steps (see settings [BB]) and not found any solution with neg red cost. After 2e+08 steps (see BB.nSteps), automatic switching to KP col gen and AFF branching --- to do it manually, set:
 CSP1.fRootPricing=1, BCP.fLocalUB=0 and seem better BCP.fLocaLReduce=0 with Subgr.nIterMax=0.  For the faster AFF branching, set BCP.nBranch=1, CSP1.nHP=1,  and BCP1.maxCuts=0 and better CSP1.fModelEquality=1 (see README)
